# Web-scraping-using-Selenium
The goal of this project is to scrape a website and store the data in an Excel file. The website scraped is a dummy website which can be found at https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/static/computers/laptops. I will be scraping all the laptops from this page with their corresponding details (title, price, description and ratings). Further analysis can be done on this data.
